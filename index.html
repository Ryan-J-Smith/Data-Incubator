# CrimeCrab

## Proposal

**Accurate modeling and prediction of criminal activity is important to:**

* State and local government, law enforcement
* Residents of the community
* Commercial ventures (real-estate, security, investment)

**Current approach to sharing information about crime:**
	
* Non-standardized across jurisdictions
* Overly literal, focusing largely on simple event reporting
* Summarized information about crime is produced and shared in static reports

**Pain points:**
	
* Crime information is often extremely fine grained, or overly coarse, or too outdated to be useful in many applications
* Lack of visaulizations and access points make it difficult to get quick answers to meaningful questions
* Lack of standardization makes integration with other applications difficult

**I propose to:**

* Create a framework for developing descriptive and predictive models of criminal activity
* Develop reusable visualizations of real crime as well as model predictions targeted to multiple audiences and industries
* Establish a RESTful API for accessing georeferenced information about crime produced by these models

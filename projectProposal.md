Accurate modeling and prediction of criminal activity is important to:
	- State and local government, law enforcement
	- Residents of the community
	- Commercial ventures (real-estate, security, investment)

Current approach to sharing information about crime:
	- Non-standardized across jurisdictions
	- Overly literal, focusing largely on simple event reporting
	- Summarized information about crime is produced and shared in static reports

Pain points:
	- Crime information is often extremely fine grained, or overly coarse, or too outdated to be useful in many applications
	- Lack of visaulizations and access points make it difficult to get quick answers to meaningful questions
	- Lack of standardization makes integration with other applications difficult

I propose to:
	- Create a framework for developing descriptive and predictive models of criminal activity
	- Develop reusable visualizations of real crime as well as model predictions targeted to multiple audiences and industries
	- Establish a RESTful API for accessing georeferenced information about crime produced by these models
